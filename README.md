# mnist-ml-classification-comparison
This project implements and compares 6 different ML classification algorithms for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It provides a comprehensive analysis of each algorithm's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency (training and prediction times).
